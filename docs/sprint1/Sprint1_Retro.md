## 1. Things That Went Well

- The team met regularly within the week to get updates and clarification on tasks.
- Members helped each other with issues they had setting up etc.
- Majority of the required tasks were completed
- Members stated if they had any issues/doubts
- The members had good teamwork and co-operated with each other well

## 2. Things That Could Have Gone Better

- Some of the tasks were overlapping, thus the workload reduced for some members. The team should aim to double check before allocating
- As we all had other assessments due during the first week of the sprint, there was an increased workload for the second week.
- There were too many branches created, instead of the team using the one feature branch
- The notion board could have been updated more often, with up to date coverage of tasks

## 3. Things That Surprised Us

The team assumed we were required to complete the sprint product at a high standard. However, after clarification with the product owner we realised that the basic functionality was enough for the time being

## 4. Lessons Learned

- As everyone is working on the one feature, we should all update the same branch
- Ensure there is no overlapping of tasks at the beginning of the sprint
- Keep notion regularly updated

## 5. Final Thoughts

- Continue with the regular meetings throughout the week to keep updated with everyone's progress
- Try to start on tasks as soon as possible
