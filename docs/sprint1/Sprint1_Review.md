**Sprint Goals**

In this sprint we wanted to add booking functionality for a customer along with the ability to see booking history.

**Status Overview**

The sprint items were mainly tasks relating to adding and viewing of booking, viewing of past bookings, and searching functionality. The sprint duration was 14 days, we divided up 40 hours among each group member for approximately 10 hours of work for each member. At the conclusion of the sprint we had 4 subtasks which meant 8 hours of work, not completed. Some tasks that were not initially included in the plan were added and appropriately scrummed, i.e. Employee and Booking back end tasks. This was 4 of the subtasks that were allocated. One of the reasons for this was that each team member had work due in other subjects and this meant that in the first week of this sprint, minimal work was done. We prioritised front-end items as we deemed this was the most important work to get done first. We made sure to do a fair amount of work on the back end to try to ensure some functionality was added. We nearly completed all tasks for this sprint which shows that when planning, we made a reasonable estimate of our capabilities as a team. We will complete any unfinished tasks and new tasks given in the next sprint. We have 3 weeks (including the Mid Semester break) and will hopefully get all our tasks done.

**Burndown Chart:**

In this chart in the first week there was less work done as the team had work to do in other subjects. However, in the second week the team worked a lot harder and got 20 hours of work done. In addition, the group was able to make significant progress in solving issues which helped us to complete more tasks as well. In terms of sprint velocity, the team&#39;s current sprint velocity is 32 hours/ 33 Story points. Our aim in future sprints will be to increase this, so that our average velocity is 40 hours/ 40-41 Story points.
