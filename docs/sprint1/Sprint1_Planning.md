2 weeks

1. What is the team's vision for this sprint?

Our team plans to implement the following features for this sprint: the home page, booking page (including creating a booking) and booking history. These implementations will allow us to meet our goal, as previously stated. Our team plans to produce only the basic functionality for these features by the end of this sprint. This is because the product owner requested to see these basic functionalities first. We will not be creating an admin account or work allocation functions, as it goes beyond the expectations and the anticipated capacity for this sprint. We will be hardcoding all users. For the booking functionality, the customer will be able to book an appointment based on a service or worker. Additionally, the one customer can book multiple services for the one appointment. The full list of tasks that have been selected for this sprint, is available on our notion task board.

1. Estimation in story points

The excel sheet with the scrum poker has been included in the submission. If there were significant difference in scoring, we had a second round of poker.
