# Steps to Deploy 

1. Ensure you have installed Terraform
2. Ensure you've set up your AWS credentials on locally (in a .sh file)
3. cd into the terraform folder in my-app
4. run terraform init to initialise repository 
5. run terraform validate to ensure the code is correct
6. run terraform fmt to fix indentation 
7. run terraform plan to see what will change without actually changing the recourses
8. run terraform apply to apply the changes for configuration 
9. run terraform destroy to delete the recourses just deployed
